Welcome to IAS's documentation!
===============================

The Iterative Alternating Sequential (IAS) algorithm is based on an iterative scheme that alternatively updates the dipole
moments Q by solving a linear least squares problem using a priorconditioned CGLS algorithm with sutable 
stopping condition and updating the hyperparameter theta by an explicit formula.
